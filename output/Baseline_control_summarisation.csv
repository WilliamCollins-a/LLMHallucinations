On Wednesday, the Palestinian Authority officially became the 123rd member of the International Criminal Court (ICC). The Palestinian government signed the ICC's founding Rome Statute in January and accepted the court's jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Palestinian territories. The ICC opened a preliminary examination into the situation in Palestinian territories in January, which could lead to war crimes investigations against Israelis. Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Malki said the move was a step towards greater justice, while rights group Human Rights Watch welcomed the development. However, Israel and the United States have opposed the Palestinians' efforts to join the ICC, with Israel describing the examination as an ""outrage"" and the United States saying it ""strongly"" disagreed with the court's decision. The ICC begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as ""Palestine."" The preliminary examination will include alleged war crimes committed since June 2014, when the war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza left over 2,000 people dead. The International Criminal Court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes."
"  According to Amnesty International's annual report on the death penalty, governments around the world are using the threat of terrorism to justify the execution of people, even if the threats are real or perceived. The report highlights the example of Pakistan lifting a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians following a terrorist attack, and China's use of the death penalty as a tool in its ""Strike Hard"" campaign against terrorism in the restive far-western province of Xinjiang. The report also notes a mixed picture of executions worldwide, with a decrease of 22% in the number of executions compared to the previous year, but a spike in the number of people sentenced to death, with at least 2,466 people globally being handed the sentence last year, an increase of 28% compared with 2013. The report also highlights the imperfections in the judiciary processes that lead to many sentenced to death, with court proceedings in many countries not meeting international fair trial standards. The report concludes that the use of the death penalty is unjust and incompatible with fundamental human rights, and Amnesty International calls for the abolition of capital punishment."
"  On May 28, 2014, the Chinese government paraded scores of prisoners dressed in orange jumpsuits in a stadium in Xinjiang, China. The prisoners were put on trial in an open air mass trial where 55 people were found guilty of various offenses linked to violent attacks in the region and were sentenced to prison. Three were sentenced to death. This mass trial was part of China's ""Strike Hard"" campaign against unrest in Xinjiang, which the government claims is aimed at combating ""terrorism"" and ""separatism"". However, this event highlights a larger trend of governments using the death penalty in a misguided and often cynical attempt to tackle crime and terrorism. According to Amnesty International's annual review of the death penalty worldwide, many countries have expanded the scope of capital crimes in their penal codes or have increased executions in response to security threats. For example, Pakistan lifted a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians in response to a Taliban attack, and Iran and Iraq have executed people for ""terrorism"". Other countries, such as Jordan and Indonesia, have also resorted to executions as a means of addressing violent crime. However, there is no evidence that the threat of execution is more of a deterrent to crime than a prison sentence, as numerous United Nations and other studies have confirmed. Therefore, Amnesty International continues to campaign for an end to the death penalty, as most of the world has already abolished it."

Anne Frank died of typhus in a Nazi concentration camp at the age of 15, just two weeks after her supposed death on March 31, 1945. New research shows that Anne and her older sister, Margot, likely died at least a month earlier than previously thought. The sisters were imprisoned at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany, where they endured harsh conditions, including overcrowding, lack of sanitation, and exposure to typhus. Witnesses at the camp reported that Anne and Margot both had symptoms of typhus before February 7, leading researchers to conclude that it is unlikely they survived until March. The exact dates of their deaths remain unclear, but their diaries and legacy continue to inspire people around the world.

  The United States and its negotiating partners reached a strong framework agreement with Iran in Lausanne, Switzerland, which limits Iran's nuclear program and effectively blocks it from building a nuclear weapon. However, there is expected to be pushback on the agreement, with some members of Congress already expressing opposition. The debate surrounding the agreement will likely be more heat than light, with misleading assumptions and doubtful assertions being made. Some of these include the idea that the negotiations' original objective was the total elimination of Iran's nuclear program, which is not true, and the assumption that Iran's nuclear program is a covert weapons program, which Iran denies and U.S. intelligence does not support. Additionally, some members of Congress have implied that the negotiations were between only the United States and Iran, when in fact they involved the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council plus Germany. The agreement does not contain a sunset clause, and Iran has ratified the Additional Protocol, which allows for expanded inspections of nuclear sites. While some have suggested that the agreement should be a formal treaty requiring Senate approval, the issue is not suited for a treaty as the restrictions and obligations in the agreement will be imposed almost exclusively on Iran, and the P5+1 are only obligated to ease and eventually remove most but not all economic sanctions. Finally, some have argued that the agreement should address Iranian missile programs, human rights violations, or support for Hamas or Hezbollah, but these issues are unrelated to the main goal of preventing a nuclear Iran, and including them in the negotiations would be a poison pill. The agreement should be judged on its merits and how it affects the security of negotiating partners and allies, including Israel, and these judgments should be based on fact-based assessments rather than questionable assumptions or dubious claims.

Deputy Sports Minister Abdolhamid Ahmadi has announced a plan to allow ""women and families"" to enter sports stadiums, but it is unclear which games they will be able to attend.

Mary Willingham, a whistleblower and critic of the NCAA, has argued that the system of eligibility certification is meaningless if the NCAA cannot ensure that courses are real and the education is genuine. Attorney Michael Hausfeld has also criticized the NCAA's inconsistency in claiming to prioritize the education of athletes while failing to regulate every professor and course at each university.

Rick Burton, a professor of sport management at Syracuse University, acknowledged that it may be unrealistic to expect the NCAA to regulate every aspect of academics at each university, but argued that the organization should be held accountable for ensuring the quality of education provided to athletes. Ramogi Huma, president of the National College Players Association, has expressed frustration with the NCAA's failure to protect athletes and its lack of transparency in investigating and enforcing safety rules.

In response to a lawsuit filed by former University of North Carolina athletes, the NCAA claimed that it did not assume a duty to ensure the quality of education provided to athletes, and that it does not have direct, day-to-day operational control over member institutions. The NCAA also likened its role to that of the American Bar Association or American Medical Association, and argued that those entities are not sued every time a lawyer or doctor acts inappropriately.

Overall, the NCAA's position on its responsibility to ensure the education of college athletes has been met with criticism and skepticism from various stakeholders. While the organization continues to assert its commitment to the academic success of athletes, its stance on its legal responsibility to enforce this commitment has raised questions about the effectiveness of its regulatory role."

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world's biggest and most powerful physics experiment, has restarted after a two-year shutdown. The LHC, located at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), is a particle accelerator that generates up to 600 million particles per second and circulates them for 10 hours, traveling more than 6 billion miles. The purpose of the LHC is to recreate the conditions that existed moments after the ""Big Bang"" and uncover how the universe evolved. Scientists hope to answer questions such as the origin of mass, why some particles are heavy while others have no mass, and the nature of dark matter and dark energy. The LHC costs approximately three billion euros and is paid for by member countries of CERN and contributions by non-member nations. The organization also follows strict guidelines for the protection of the environment and personnel. Scientists and physics enthusiasts are eagerly awaiting the results of the LHC's experiments, which will be conducted at new record levels of energy."
  The text reports on the ongoing conflict in Yemen, specifically in the capital city of Sanaa, where the Saudi-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against Houthi rebels. The airstrikes have caused significant damage to infrastructure and have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people in less than two weeks. The International Committee of the Red Cross has called for a humanitarian ceasefire to allow aid to reach those in need, but a draft resolution submitted to the U.N. Security Council has not been approved. The conflict in Yemen has been ongoing since the Houthi rebels forced the country's president, Abdrabu Mansour Hadi, to flee in February. The Houthis are allied with Iran, which has been accused of supporting the rebels, while Hadi is backed by Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations. The conflict has created a power vacuum in the country, allowing terror group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to operate with little resistance.
  The article discusses several cases involving the use of religion as a defense against legal challenges. The cases cover a range of religious practices and beliefs, from the use of eagle feathers by a Native American for spiritual purposes, to the use of a sacramental tea by a Brazilian faith, to a Sikh woman's right to wear a kirpan as a mandatory article of faith. The article highlights how state religious freedom laws, such as Indiana's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act, have been used to defend against legal challenges, but also raises questions about the effectiveness of these laws in providing meaningful protections for religious believers. The article also notes that the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act has been used in some cases, but the outcomes have been mixed. The article concludes that while the laws may provide some protection for religious beliefs and practices, there is still reason to doubt their effectiveness in providing meaningful protections.
  Al-Shabaab, a terrorist group based in Somalia, has claimed responsibility for an attack on Garissa University College in eastern Kenya, resulting in multiple deaths and kidnappings. The attack is part of an ongoing escalation of the group's activities and a deteriorating security situation in East Africa. Al-Shabaab has been active in Kenya since 2011, carrying out cross-border raids and kidnappings. The group is driven by a radical interpretation of the Quran and has ties to al-Qaeda and ISIS. Its activities are fueled by a range of factors, including economic development challenges, environmental degradation, organized crime, corruption, and human rights abuses. The group exploits religious, tribal, and nationalist identities to recruit supporters. Addressing the underlying issues of exclusion and inequality in the region is crucial to finding a lasting solution to the security problems posed by Al-Shabaab. Military action alone will not be enough to counter the group, and a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of the problem is necessary.

  On March 5th, U.S. Ambassador Mark Lippert was stabbed during an event in Seoul, South Korea. The attacker, Kim Ki-Jong, has been charged with attempted murder, assaulting a foreign envoy, and business obstruction. According to South Korean law, Kim's trial must begin within 14 days of receiving today's indictment. It is alleged that Kim stabbed Lippert because he opposed the joint South Korean-U.S. military drills, which North Korea frequently criticizes. Kim has a history of unpredictable behavior, including a previous conviction for throwing a piece of concrete at a Japanese ambassador to South Korea. South Korean President Park Geun-hye condemned the attack, calling it an attack on the South Korea-U.S. alliance and stating that it cannot be tolerated.
"  President Barack Obama has been tied to the mast of a nuclear deal with Iran since before he became the Democratic candidate for president. Reaching a good, solid agreement with Iran is a worthy and desirable goal, but the process has been influenced by political considerations, weakening America's hand and strengthening Iran's. Obama's political standing and his legacy in foreign policy are intertwined with reaching an accord with Iran, and if the deal collapses, he may be seen as having sacrificed his legacy.

The United States and Iran are engaged in talks to limit Iran's nuclear program, but the negotiations have been marred by political considerations rather than strategic ones. Iran is believed to want to develop nuclear weapons, while the international community wants to delay this as much as possible, and preferably forever. The world has learned that Iran has a history of lying and hiding elements of its nuclear program, and Iran's neighbors do not trust it.

The framework agreement reached by the two sides starts lifting essential sanctions too soon, allowing Iran to continue enriching uranium at a lower level. Iran will become a nuclear threshold state, with the capability to make the final push to a bomb within a year after inspectors detect any violations. The Fordow facility, located in a fortified bunker, will remain in existence, although converted to a nuclear research facility. International sanctions will start lifting almost immediately, and Iran's nuclear infrastructure will remain in place, operating at a reduced pace.

The deal does not look reassuring, especially given Iran's gains in Arab lands and its threats against Israel and Saudi Arabia. While a diplomatic solution is the most desirable option, the deal does not do enough to ensure global safety from nuclear proliferation and instability in the Middle East.

In summary, the negotiations between the United States and Iran have been influenced by political considerations rather than strategic ones, and the deal reached so far does not appear to be reassuring, particularly given Iran's aggressive actions in the region."

"  On November 1, 2020, Hong Kong police responded to a call at an apartment in the Wan Chai area and found two dead bodies, one of which was stuffed inside a suitcase on the balcony. The victims were identified as 29-year-old Seneng Mujiasih and 25-year-old Sumarti Ningsih. The former banker, Rurik Jutting, was charged with two counts of murder.

Mujiasih was a domestic worker from Indonesia who had overstayed her visa, while Ningsih was visiting Hong Kong as a tourist and was due to fly back to Jakarta the day after her body was found. Jutting, who lived at the murder scene, was detained at the scene and later charged with the murders.

The case has shocked the city, and fellow domestic workers held a vigil in Hong Kong's Victoria Park to pay tribute to the victims. The bodies of the victims were repatriated to Indonesia for burial, and Jutting's trial is ongoing.

During the trial, tests were conducted to determine if Jutting was psychologically fit to enter a plea, and he was found to be mentally fit. The case was then adjourned to allow for the analysis of over 200 pieces of forensic and DNA evidence.

The motive for the murders is still unclear, but the case has raised concerns about the treatment of domestic workers in Hong Kong and the need for better protection for these vulnerable individuals."

"  According to an outside review by Columbia Journalism School professors, Rolling Stone magazine failed in its reporting and editing processes, leading to a false and damaging article about a sexual assault at the University of Virginia. The article has been widely criticized for its lack of factual accuracy and its harmful portrayal of the fraternity and university. The review found that the magazine's failure extended to all aspects of the editorial process, including reporting, editing, and fact-checking.

In response to the criticism, Rolling Stone's managing editor, Will Dana, apologized to readers and to the members of the fraternity and university involved. However, the question of whether the fraternity can sue Rolling Stone for defamation remains. The Virginia Supreme Court has established the elements of libel, which include publication of an actionable statement with the requisite intent. However, the law also protects freedom of speech, and defamatory statements about private individuals cannot be actionable unless they are proven to be false and defamatory.

The identity of the plaintiff matters in a defamation case, as only private individuals can bring suit. In this case, the university cannot sue for defamation because it is a governmental entity. However, the fraternity members may be able to bring a suit if they can demonstrate that the defamatory statements were about them individually, rather than just the fraternity as a whole. The small group exception may apply in this case, as the fraternity is a relatively small group of individuals who have been impacted by the false and damaging statements.

It is worth noting that defamation cases are rare and typically require proof of financial harm. Therefore, it is unlikely that the fraternity members will be able to bring a successful defamation suit without demonstrating tangible financial damage. However, the UVA situation is unique, and if the fraternity members can make a strong case for damages, they may be able to overcome the preliminary hurdles of a defamation claim."
"  The classic video game ""Space Invaders"" was created in Japan in the late 1970s, and now, in Japan's political circles, there is a discussion about the possibility of extraterrestrial life. The Japanese Defense Minister, Gen Nakatani, revealed that the country's Air Self Defense Force (ASDF) has never encountered any unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from outer space. He stated that if the ASDF detects any indications of a UFO that could potentially violate Japan's airspace, they will scramble fighter jets and make visual observations. Nakatani confirmed that they have found birds or other flying objects, but he is not aware of any UFOs from outside of Earth.

A former professional wrestler-turned-lawmaker, Antonio Inoki, asked the Defense Minister if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats, and if any research was being conducted on alien visitors. Nakatani replied that they do not have any personal experience or knowledge of aliens existing. This exchange is not the first time Japanese politicians have discussed the implications of extraterrestrial life. In 2007, the then-Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba considered the legal ramifications of defending against an invasion from outer space under Japan's pacifist constitution."

The Shibuya ward in Tokyo has passed an ordinance that will allow same-sex couples to obtain ""partnership certificates"" granting them some of the rights of married heterosexual couples. The certificates will allow same-sex partners to visit each other in hospitals and co-sign tenancy agreements. While the certificates are not legally binding, they are seen as a step towards promoting marriage equality in Japan. The move was proposed by the Shibuya mayor in February and was passed on Wednesday. The decision is a significant step forward for the LGBT community in Japan, where same-sex marriage is not yet legal. While the ordinance does not grant all the rights of married couples, it is seen as a positive development in the fight for LGBT rights in Japan.

The decision was welcomed by LGBT activists and politicians, who see it as a way to make the LGBT community more visible and to educate society about their issues. However, conservative groups have opposed the move, arguing that it would degrade the ""familial system and practice that heterosexual unions have long preserved in human history."" Despite this opposition, the Shibuya ward's decision is seen as a significant step towards promoting LGBT rights in Japan.

The ordinance is expected to take effect in the coming months, and other municipalities in Japan are expected to follow suit. The decision has also sparked a national debate on LGBT rights, with polls showing that a slight majority of the population opposes gay marriage, but support is higher among younger generations.

On Good Friday, the author notes that Jesus suffered and died on the cross, symbolizing the human experience of suffering and loss. Holy Saturday is seen as a time of transition and uncertainty, but also as a time of hope and anticipation for the resurrection to come. Easter Sunday is the culmination of the Triduum, representing the triumph of life over death and the promise of transformation and renewal.

The author emphasizes that the Easter Triduum is not just a one-day event, but rather a three-day cycle that reflects the human experience of moving through darkness and into light. They suggest that we all experience the Triduum frequently, and that it serves as a reminder to expect movement through darkness into light, and to celebrate the promise of transformation and renewal.

Overall, the author argues that Easter is a holiday that resists commercialization and cultural warring, and instead offers a powerful symbol of hope and renewal that can be appreciated by people of all faiths and backgrounds."
  The text discusses how the early Jesus movement supported itself financially. According to the New Testament, money was a concern for Jesus and his disciples, who had a common purse to survive. Jesus' ministry functioned at a subsistence level, and he and his followers received donations from supporters, including substantial ones from some of the rich people who were drawn to his ministry despite his preaching on the perils of wealth. The text highlights the contributions of specific women, such as Mary Magdalene and Joanna, who provided for Jesus and his disciples out of their resources. These women were likely from affluent families or had their own means of supporting the ministry. The text also mentions men like Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, who were rich and supported Jesus' ministry. After Jesus' death and resurrection, the movement grew exponentially, and the church's relationship to money became more complicated as the needs became greater.

Tuesday will be a significant day in the United States with several high-profile court cases and political elections taking place. In Massachusetts, the trials of former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez and Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev are coming to a close. In Kentucky, Senator Rand Paul has announced that he will run for president. In Chicago, voters are going to the polls in a runoff election between Mayor Rahm Emanuel and challenger Jesus ""Chuy"" Garcia. In Ferguson, Missouri, the election will take place amidst the ongoing protests over the death of Michael Brown.

The Hernandez trial has been ongoing for several weeks, with prosecutors presenting 131 witnesses to support their claim that Hernandez killed semi-pro player Odin Lloyd. The defense team wrapped up its witnesses in less than a day, and closing arguments are scheduled for Tuesday. The jury will then begin deliberations. The Tsarnaev trial has been particularly dramatic, with survivors and victims' families weeping and Tsarnaev fidgeting at the defense table as jurors heard a prosecutor allege that he brought terrorism into the backyards and main streets. The jury is expected to begin deliberations soon after Tuesday's closing arguments.

In Kentucky, Paul is expected to hit the campaign trail visiting early voting states and building a coalition of younger voters and traditional Republicans. In Chicago, the election is being billed as a battle for the ""future of Chicago,"" with Emanuel facing off against Garcia. The timing of the election is also significant, as it comes after a surge in early voting in the city.

Finally, in Ferguson, the election will take place amidst ongoing protests over the death of Michael Brown. The election will bring change to the city's leadership, with two black men running for one of the open seats and a white protester running for a third post. Residents are speaking out ahead of the election, with many expressing frustration over the lack of representation of the city's black population in its police force and City Council."
  Ted Cruz, a presidential candidate, recently visited Cedar Falls, Iowa, where he connected with voters on a religious level. During a event, a tall, burly man approached Cruz and asked if he could pray with him. Cruz agreed and the two bowed their heads in prayer. This interaction was just one of many instances where Cruz showed a pastoral swagger, embracing people's hands, softening his tone, and looking them square in the eye. Cruz is known for his strong conservative views and his ability to connect with evangelical Christians. He has built a brand as a stalwart defender of religious freedom and has been vocal about his own faith. In Iowa, where the next presidential caucuses will take place, Cruz is focusing on courting evangelicals, who make up a large segment of the state's Republican voter bloc. He believes that if he can tap into the evangelical vote, he can make up for any lack of support among other demographics. While Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum, the past winners of the Iowa caucuses, are likely to run again, the competition among the GOP candidates will be stiff. Cruz's three-pronged strategy to win the nomination includes dominating the tea party faction and competing for the libertarian base. He is also focusing on appealing to the Ron Paul-Rand Paul faction of the party, which is younger and more libertarian-minded. To win the nomination, Cruz believes that he needs to bridge the gap between these two factions. He has been saying that he wants to see a return of the evangelical vote to 2004 levels, when more than six in 10 evangelicals voted in the presidential election. His campaign believes that if they can tap into the evangelical vote, they can make up for any lack of support among other demographics. However, other candidates, such as Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, and Marco Rubio, are also courting evangelical voters. The competition among the candidates will be fierce, and it remains to be seen who will emerge as the front-runner among the evangelical vote.

A jury found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty on Wednesday of all 30 counts he faced in the Boston Marathon bombing trial, including 17 capital charges that make him eligible for the death penalty. The trial will now move into a penalty phase, where the jury will hear testimony and arguments from both sides and ultimately decide whether Tsarnaev, 21, will be executed. The defense strategy was to focus on convincing the jury to spare Tsarnaev's life by arguing that his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died in a shootout with police days after the terror attack, was the instigator of the marathon plot and that Tsarnaev was only following his lead. The prosecution presented 92 witnesses, while the defense presented only four. The jury will now consider aggravating factors such as the heinousness of the crimes and Tsarnaev's relative youth, as well as mitigating factors such as his family and mental health history. The defense faces an uphill battle in convincing the jury that Tsarnaev does not deserve the death penalty.

Chokalingam, the brother of Mindy Kaling, applied to 14 medical schools under the pseudonym ""JoJo"" and received interviews from 11 schools. He claims that his decision to pose as a black man was motivated by a desire to illustrate the unfair advantage that black and other underrepresented minorities receive when applying to prestigious schools.

"  The VII Summit of the Americas was expected to be a symbolic moment when the US and Cuba would shake hands, but instead, it became a ""triangle of tension"" due to Venezuela's involvement. The summit was meant to be a chance for heads of state from 35 countries in the Western Hemisphere to discuss economic, social, or political issues since the summit's creation in 1994. Cuba had been the bone of contention, with some Latin American leaders threatening not to attend if the US and Canada didn't invite President Raul Castro. However, when President Barack Obama and Castro announced the end of the Cold War rivalry on December 17, 2014, attention shifted to the summit, where Obama and Castro would meet face-to-face for the first time since the about-face. The much-anticipated handshake between Obama and Castro would have stolen the spotlight if it weren't for Cuba's strongest ally, Venezuela. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro accused the US of trying to topple his government and banned former President George Bush, former Vice President Dick Cheney, and Senators Bob Menendez and Marco Rubio from entering Venezuela. The US State Department dismissed the allegations of US involvement in a coup plot against Maduro as ""baseless and false."" In response, Obama issued an executive order sanctioning seven Venezuelan officials for human rights violations and declared Venezuela a ""threat to national security."" Maduro rallied other Latin American leaders, including Bolivian President Evo Morales, Ecuador's Rafael Correa, and Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega, but Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez publicly sided with Maduro, condemning US sanctions against Venezuela and expressing support for the Bolivarian Revolution. The summit's outcome remains uncertain as more Latin American diplomats may side with Maduro, creating a tense situation for the US."
  The text outlines the author's concerns about the nuclear deal between Iran and the United States, as well as its allies. The author argues that the deal gives Iran too much leverage and does not include tough enough safeguards to prevent cheating. The author also notes that Iran has been supporting terrorist groups and destabilizing the region while negotiating the deal, and suggests that the deal is not a good enough reason to hand over billions of dollars to a regime that behaves this way. The author concludes that the deal is not a good deal and that the United States should have insisted on tougher conditions to prevent Iran from cheating and to ensure that the deal is in the best interests of the United States and its allies.
"  Martin O'Malley and Jim Webb are two Democrats who are considering running for president in 2016. They shared a stage at the Polk County Democrats Awards Dinner in Des Moines, Iowa, on Friday night, but their approaches and demeanors were different. O'Malley is a more outgoing and retail politician, shaking hands and introducing himself to everyone he meets. Webb, on the other hand, is more stoic and reserved, preferring to focus on smaller groups of people rather than trying to shake every hand in the room.

Despite their differences, both O'Malley and Webb are facing long odds in their potential presidential bids. Hillary Clinton, who is expected to announce her presidential bid soon, leads every national and state poll of the Democratic field. O'Malley and Webb are both looking up at her, with O'Malley polling at 1% nationally and Webb at 3% in Iowa.

During their speeches, Webb and O'Malley highlighted different areas of focus. Webb spoke about basic governance, economic justice, and criminal justice reform, while O'Malley focused on issues such as better wages for workers and expanding education benefits for veterans. Webb also emphasized the importance of retail politics, but with a more skeptical view than O'Malley.

After the event, Webb stuck around to meet with veterans and shake hands, while O'Malley left for New York. Webb's approach to retail politics seems to be more focused and targeted, while O'Malley's is more high-energy and trying to make connections with as many people as possible.

Overall, while both O'Malley and Webb are facing long odds in their potential presidential bids, they have different strengths and weaknesses that could play out in their campaigns."
"  Walter Scott, a 50-year-old black man, was shot and killed by a white police officer, Michael Slager, in North Charleston, South Carolina on April 4, 2015. The shooting was captured on a cell phone video by a passerby, which showed Scott running from the officer before being shot multiple times. The officer has been charged with murder, and the case has sparked protests and calls for police reform.

According to the account of a witness who recorded the cell phone video, Scott and Slager were involved in a physical altercation before the shooting. However, the official investigation found inconsistencies in the officer's account of the events leading up to the shooting. The witness, Feidin Santana, said he saw Slager on top of Scott, with Scott trying to get away. He also said he heard a Taser being used.

The shooting has raised questions about racial prejudice and police brutality, with many calling for justice and reforms. The family of Scott has hired an attorney to represent them, and protests have been held in Charleston and other cities to demand justice. The case has also highlighted the need for better training and accountability within law enforcement agencies.

An Iranian military observation aircraft flew within 50 yards of an armed US Navy helicopter over the Persian Gulf in a recent incident that has raised concerns about Iranian military command and control. According to US military officials, the Iranian aircraft made two passes at the helicopter before it moved away, and there were no shots fired. The incident occurred as the US and other world powers meet with Iran in Switzerland to negotiate a nuclear deal, and it has raised concerns about the risk of escalation. The US administration is considering a demarche protest against Iran, but Iranian officials have not responded to CNN's requests for comment. This type of incident has occurred several times a month, but after the recent incident, US naval intelligence did not see the Iranian observation aircraft again for two weeks, leading to the conclusion that the incident may have been ordered by a local commander who was reprimanded by higher-ups. The US military has expressed concerns about the aggressive actions of some Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps forces, and this incident highlights the ongoing tensions between the US and Iran in the region.

"  The text describes the author's journey towards reawakening their faith in the Catholic Church through Pope Francis' leadership. The author describes how they stopped praying after the death of their brother, Jimmy, who died of cancer at the age of 25. They felt angry at God and disconnected from the Church. However, they were inspired by Pope Francis' approach to religion, which emphasizes compassion, love, and acceptance rather than judgment.

The author meets Cardinal Gerald Lacroix, who explains how Pope Francis' tone and approach to religion differ from previous Popes. Lacroix highlights how Francis is not judgmental and instead focuses on preaching the love of God. Lacroix also emphasizes that the Church will never promote same-sex marriage, but it will welcome and accompany homosexual persons.

The author is moved by Lacroix's words and realizes that they had been misunderstanding the Church's teachings and approach to sinners. They feel inspired to return to Church and pray for forgiveness, with the hope of receiving Christ's love and growth. The text concludes with the author expressing their excitement to attend Church the next Sunday and experience the openness and compassion of the Church under Pope Francis' leadership."
"  Mullah Mohammed Omar, the founder and leader of the Taliban, is still alive, according to a newly released biography by the group. The biography aims to dispel rumors of Omar's death and provide details about his daily work schedule and leadership role within the movement.

According to the biography, Omar was born in 1960 in a village in Afghanistan's Kandahar province and studied at a religious school run by his uncle. He later commanded rebel groups against the Soviet invasion and became involved in the Taliban movement in the 1990s. The biography makes no mention of the Taliban's alliance with Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda.

The publication of the biography comes at a time when there have been growing speculation about Omar's death and the rise of a new leader, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The Taliban have been silent on the issue of Omar's leadership, leading some to speculate that he may have died. However, the biography suggests that Omar is still actively leading the movement, providing orders to his commanders and overseeing a leadership council, judiciary, and nine executive commissions.

The biography also provides some details about Omar's personal life, including that he preferred to use the RPG-7 rocket-propelled grenade as his weapon of choice and that he was blinded in his right eye during a battle.

The publication of the biography has been seen as an attempt by the Taliban to assert their leadership and legitimacy, particularly in the face of growing competition from ISIS. However, the biography's release has also been met with skepticism, with some questioning the accuracy of the information provided and others suggesting that it may be an attempt to create a mythical figure around Omar."
"  The Amnesty International report highlights the increasing violence against women's rights activists in Afghanistan, including the brutal murder of Farkhunda, a young woman who was burned to death in Kabul. The report notes that while the number of women killed in Afghanistan has increased by 20% in 2013 compared to the previous year, the government has done little to protect them. The report also highlights the resilience of Afghan women's rights activists, who continue to fight for their rights despite the violence and threats they face. The report quotes Horia Mosadiq, Amnesty's Afghanistan researcher, as saying that the Afghan government has failed to hold perpetrators accountable and that the response to Farkhunda's killing has been a ""silver lining"" in a country where women's rights are under threat. The report also highlights the importance of male support for women's rights, with some male onlookers at Farkhunda's funeral and protests against her death showing their support for the cause. The report concludes that the fight for women's rights in Afghanistan is ongoing and that more needs to be done to protect and support women's activists."

Sweden grants 480 days of paid parental leave, with 390 days paid at 80% of income and a maximum of $3,474 per month. However, 60 of these days must be ""daddy months"" or ""partner months"" that are shared between both parents. If the 60 days are not used, the maximum leave is reduced to 420 days.

The film is set in a decaying Detroit, which Gosling has a personal connection to as he grew up ""not too far away"" in Cornwall, Ontario. The film began as a collection of shots of the Brewster-Douglass Projects, the first black social housing development in America, which Gosling heard were going to be torn down. He wanted to capture the buildings before they were gone, and this eventually evolved into a full-fledged film.

The film explores the themes of destruction and regeneration, with a focus on the human element.

"  The text discusses the ongoing trial of former NFL player Aaron Hernandez, who is accused of killing semi-pro player Odin Lloyd in 2013. The prosecution has presented 131 witnesses to support their claim, while the defense has wrapped up its witnesses in less than a day. The key points that jurors will have to consider include:

1. Aaron Hernandez lied to his boss, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, when he claimed he was innocent and had no knowledge of Lloyd's death.
2. Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, revealed that he had dispossed of a box that reeked of marijuana, which may contradict the prosecution's contention that the weapon used in the killing was in the box.
3. The shoes Hernandez wore the night Lloyd was shot were a distinctive style, the Air Jordan Retro 11 Lows, and the impression of the sole found at the crime scene matched the size 13 shoe.
4. The prosecution used grainy footage from Hernandez's home security system to suggest he was holding a.45-caliber handgun, the same kind of gun police said was used to kill Lloyd.
5. The defense questioned the science behind analyzing footprints and introduced a March 2014 investigative report suggesting the partial footwear impression lacked detail and quality to make a comparison.
6. The case gets more complicated, as evidence collected in Lloyd's death investigation led to two more murder charges against Hernandez in a separate case in Boston.
7. The judge has banned any mention of the double murder in Lloyd's trial, ruling it is prejudicial.

Overall, the trial is focused on the prosecution's claim that Hernandez orchestrated the murder of Lloyd, and the defense is trying to cast doubt on the prosecution's evidence. The case is complex and the jury will have to consider a lot of circumstantial evidence before reaching a verdict."
"  Adelma Cifuentes, a Guatemalan woman, lived through 12 years of abuse from her husband, including beatings, name-calling, and humiliation. Despite the danger, she found a way to escape her abuser and seek justice. Her case is just one of many in Guatemala, where gender-based violence is a severe problem. According to the United Nations, nearly 10 out of every 100,000 women are killed in Guatemala, and the country ranks third in the world in femicides. The legacy of violence from the country's 36-year civil war has contributed to a culture of impunity and discrimination, and military and paramilitary groups that committed atrocities during the war are still integrated into society with little consequences.

The situation for girls and women in Guatemala is particularly alarming, with many facing poverty, lack of education, and a deeply entrenched patriarchal society that condones violence against them. However, there are signs of change, with organizations such as CICAM providing support to survivors of abuse and challenging harmful social norms. The government is also taking steps to address the problem, including passing a law against femicide and establishing a specialized court to try violent crimes against women.

International nongovernmental organizations are also playing a critical role in the fight against gender-based violence in Guatemala, engaging men and boys as champions of change and facilitating debates to challenge harmful norms. While there is hope for change, the problem of gender-based violence in Guatemala is one that requires international attention and immediate action. Survivors like Adelma Cifuentes are finding strength through theater and support from other survivors, but millions of other women trapped in a cycle of violence need help now."

The article was later retracted by Rolling Stone, and the university launched an investigation into how it handles sexual assault cases.

According to the article, the UVA administration has never expelled a student for sexual assault, even when the student admitted to it. The article also highlights the lack of a zero-tolerance policy on sexual assault at the university.

  The article discusses the discovery of graffiti left by World War I soldiers in a French chalk quarry. The graffiti includes the names and ranks of the soldiers, as well as their hometowns and units. The quarry is located near the battlefields of the Somme, where many of the soldiers fought and died. The graffiti is estimated to be around 100 years old and provides a glimpse into the lives of the soldiers who fought in the war. The discovery of the graffiti is significant because it provides a human connection to the soldiers who lived a century ago and offers insight into their experiences and thoughts during the war. The article also mentions that the graffiti is plain and stark, with some of the names and ranks of the soldiers still visible today. Additionally, the article highlights the efforts of photographer Jeff Gusky, who has been chronicling the details of the site, and the importance of promoting awareness of the area's history.
  The text reports on the delay in the confirmation of Loretta Lynch as Attorney General of the United States. Lynch was nominated by President Obama in November, but her confirmation has been delayed due to a lack of a confirmation vote by the full Senate. The delay has lasted longer than any other attorney general nominee in recent history, with the Senate returning from recess on Monday. The reasons for the delay are attributed to partisan battles and a fight over a human trafficking bill. Supporters of Lynch have organized to convince the state's two Republican senators to support her confirmation, but they have faced resistance. The NAACP has organized protests outside the senators' offices, and the President has turned up the heat on the confirmation process. The text also highlights the historical significance of Lynch's nomination, as she would be the first African-American woman to hold the position of Attorney General.

"  The text discusses the possibility of life existing elsewhere in the universe, particularly on exoplanets that are similar to Earth. NASA scientists have outlined a plan to discover life on these exoplanets over the next decade or two. They have identified several key factors that suggest the existence of life on exoplanets, including the presence of liquid water, the presence of organic molecules, and the presence of an oxygen-rich atmosphere.

The text also considers the likelihood of intelligent life existing on exoplanets. While simple forms of life may be common, the likelihood of finding intelligent life that can communicate via radio waves is relatively low. The odds of finding human-like life on exoplanets are estimated to be around 0.000002%, or 1 in 50,000. However, if there are 40 billion Earth-like planets in the Milky Way galaxy, the odds of finding intelligent life on at least one of them improve significantly.

The text also notes that advanced civilizations may have the capability to destroy their planet, and that the duration of the Communication Age on a planet could be short. The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) has been ongoing for over 30 years, with no definitive evidence of life found yet. However, future missions, such as NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, are expected to provide more insight into the possibility of life existing on exoplanets.

In summary, while the possibility of life existing on exoplanets is considered to be high, the likelihood of finding intelligent life that can communicate via radio waves is relatively low. The search for extraterrestrial intelligence continues, and future missions are expected to provide more insight into this fascinating topic."
"  The text describes a recent high-profile heist in London, in which a group of thieves broke into a safety deposit box facility and stole millions of pounds worth of valuables. The article provides insight into the methods and motives of such criminals, drawing on the experience of a former commander of specialist operations at London's Scotland Yard.

According to the article, the thieves in this case were not your average burglars, but rather highly organized and sophisticated criminals who used inside information to carry out the heist. They likely had a detailed plan and timeline, and used vehicles and equipment purchased or stolen for the job. The thieves also had untraceable disposable phones and an outside team to warn the inside men of any problems.

The article highlights that the types of things stolen in such heists are not too dissimilar from one another, with cash being the most desirable followed by easily convertible items like gold, jewelry, and watches. However, fine paintings and rare antiques are less desirable for experienced criminals due to their identifiability and the smaller black market.

The investigation into the heist will involve a thorough forensic analysis of the crime scene, including the use of DNA evidence, CCTV footage, and rewards for information. The police will also analyze the movements of known criminals and use their criminal intelligence branch to gather information from informants. The article notes that the detectives investigating these crimes see them as an exciting challenge to their professionalism, but they will still be relentless in their pursuit of the thieves.

Overall, the article provides a detailed look at the methods and motives of highly organized and sophisticated criminals, as well as the efforts of law enforcement to investigate and bring them to justice."

  A New York judge recently approved a novel method of serving divorce papers to a husband: through Facebook. This may seem surprising, but it is not a new frontier in the world of legal service. In fact, service by publication or nailing papers to the door of an empty apartment are already established methods. However, these traditional methods are not always reliable, especially in a world where people are increasingly hard to find. Enter online service, which can track the defendant's online activity and ensure that they receive notice of the lawsuit. While some may be concerned about the privacy implications of serving papers through Facebook, it is worth noting that most of us spend more time online than we do at our physical addresses. In fact, online service has the added benefit of tracking, which can help ensure that the defendant has received notice of the lawsuit. So, while the older methods of alternate service may be public, online service is a more reliable and trackable method of ensuring that a defendant receives notice of a lawsuit.

3. Don't use rejection to measure the merit of an idea. Rejection often says more about the rejector than the rejectee.
4. Don't run away after a rejection. Instead, be confident, engaging, and collaborative to minimize the chance of rejection.
5. Ask why you were rejected and find solutions to solve that why.
6. Set a number of how many no's you can take before giving up.

The findings were conclusive, with the match between the play and Shakespeare's writing being a ""landslide."" The study found that the first half of the play was almost entirely written by Shakespeare, while the second half was split evenly between Shakespeare and Fletcher. Only tiny traces of Theobald's signature were found. The discovery could settle a long-standing debate over the authorship of ""Double Falsehood,"" with many scholars previously dismissing the play as a fake. Shakespeare, who died in 1616, wrote most of his published plays between 1590 and 1612. The publication of ""Double Falsehood"" in 2010 sparked renewed claims by experts that it was Shakespeare's work. However, the new study may now provide conclusive evidence of Shakespeare's authorship."

On Thursday, April 2, militants massacred 147 people at a university in Garissa, Kenya. In response, the Kenyan government froze dozens of accounts linked to suspected terror supporters. The government has been tracking the finances of people suspected of ties to Al-Shabaab, the militant group that claimed responsibility for the attack, since 2011. So far, 86 accounts have been frozen, but this number could increase. The government has a list of suspects from various parts of the country, with the majority being in Nairobi and Mombasa. Kenyans gathered at Uhuru Park in Nairobi to mourn the victims on Tuesday night, where hundreds gathered and unloaded 147 crosses, some draped with the nation's flag. The victims included 142 students at the university and the rest were security forces and campus security. The attack has sparked heavy criticism for the government's response, with some questioning why the rapid response team was stuck in Nairobi for hours after the massacre. The government has also launched airstrikes targeting Al-Shabaab's training camps in Somalia and offered a reward of 20 million Kenyan shillings for information on the whereabouts of a senior Al-Shabaab leader."
  Paddy Power, an Irish betting company, has faced backlash after tweeting a controversial statement linking the number of games Newcastle United has lost to Liverpool to recent police killings of unarmed African-American men in the United States. The tweet, which has since been deleted, was intended to promote a piece showing statistics for games between the two teams ahead of their English Premier League match on Monday. However, the tweet was met with widespread criticism, with some calling for the person who wrote it to be sacked. Paddy Power has since apologized and stated that the tweet was not intended to be offensive. In related news, Paddy Power has also been criticized for backing David Ginola's failed candidacy for the presidency of world football's governing body, with some viewing the move as a publicity stunt. The company has a history of generating headlines with its publicity stunts, but this incident has raised concerns about the company's sensitivity and cultural awareness.
  Malala Yousafzai, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, has been given an asteroid in space. Amy Mainzer, an astrophysicist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, named the asteroid 316201 Malala after the teenage education activist from Pakistan. Malala was shot by the Pakistani Taliban for promoting girls' education. Despite being gravely wounded, she recovered with no serious neurological damage and has continued to be a powerful advocate for education. Mainzer, who also consults for PBS on a children's educational science show, believes that educating girls around the world is crucial for increasing human potential and solving some of humanity's most difficult problems. The asteroid, which is about 4 kilometers in diameter and circles the sun between Mars and Jupiter every five and a half years, is now officially known as 316201 Malala or 2010 ML48.
"  Last month, Wu Rongrong was taken into custody for planning to protest on International Women's Day against sexual harassment in China. Since then, the Chinese authorities have detained her and four other activists for ""creating disturbances."" They have also detained some of the activists' supporters, raided a prominent nongovernmental organization that called for their release, and have denied some of the women access to medical treatment, lawyers, and adequate rest. The fate of the five will be revealed by April 13, when their case reaches the legal time limit, either leading to their release or ""formally arrested,"" which usually results in conviction in China's legal system.

The detentions of China's most inventive women's rights activists are ironic, coming on the day that marks women's achievements and their struggle for equality. This year also marks the 20th anniversary of the influential Fourth World Conference on Women hosted in Beijing, where Hillary Clinton famously declared that ""women's rights are human rights.""

Wu Rongrong and her colleagues fight against overt rights violations by the Chinese government and against the wider gender norms that relegate women to second-class citizens. They have used innovative tactics, such as occupying public toilets and donning blood-spattered wedding gowns to protest domestic violence, to raise awareness of gender inequality in ways that resonate with young women in China.

However, the Chinese government's response to these activists has been to harass, detain, and imprison them. The authorities have also tried to co-opt some groups by allowing them to provide services the government finds acceptable, so long as they abandon their activism. This ""differentiated management"" of nongovernmental organizations may work to neutralize some of the more outspoken groups, but it is unlikely to address the underlying desires for change among ordinary people.

The Chinese Communist Party faces a dizzying array of challenges, including that younger generations do not identify with the party or its values like past generations. Instead of treating activists like criminals, the party could resolve some of these challenges by freeing and engaging them."
"  Jodi Arias was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole on Monday for the 2008 murder of her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander. Arias expressed remorse for her actions, saying she was ""truly disgusted and repulsed"" by what she had done. Travis Alexander's sisters gave victim impact statements, with one saying she was trying to cope with her brother's death by blocking him from her memory. Arias was found guilty of first-degree murder in 2013 and was eligible for the death penalty, but a second jury was unable to reach a unanimous decision on her fate. As a result, the judge sentenced Arias to life in prison without the possibility of parole. She will serve her sentence at the Lumley Unit in the Arizona State Prison Complex-Perryville."
  The Attorney General of the United States, Eric Holder, has issued a memo to all Department of Justice personnel stating that soliciting prostitutes is strictly prohibited, regardless of the legality of prostitution in a particular jurisdiction. The memo comes in response to recent reports of federal agents engaging in sexual misconduct overseas, including attending sex parties with paid prostitutes. The memo emphasizes that all department personnel, including attorneys and law enforcement officers, are prohibited from soliciting, procuring, or accepting commercial sex. Holder's memo also highlights that if any employee from the ATF, FBI, Federal Bureau of Prisons, or a federal prosecutor is caught with a prostitute, they will be suspended or fired. The memo reiterates that this rule applies at all times during an individual's employment, including while off duty or on personal leave. The directive is intended to maintain the integrity of the department and to prevent any actions that could undermine its mission.
"  Hillary Clinton has announced her candidacy for the 2016 presidential election, and her campaign has already sparked discussions about gender equality in the United States. The author of the text argues that Clinton's candidacy has created a burden for her that no male candidate would ever have to shoulder. The author highlights two potential outcomes: a win or a loss.

If Clinton wins the election, it will be a significant step towards gender equality, as the United States will have a woman in the White House. However, the author notes that this victory will not necessarily mean that women are fully politically included, as 80% of elected officials throughout the country will still be men. Additionally, challenges such as pay inequality, sexual assault, and human trafficking will still persist.

On the other hand, if Clinton loses, it could perpetuate the myth that women cannot win big elections, and that the electoral environment is rife with bias and discrimination. The author notes that potential female candidates may blame Clinton's loss on the electoral environment being unfair to women.

The author also highlights that Clinton's campaign will face challenges such as sexist comments and misogynistic memes on social media. However, the author notes that these challenges are not unique to Clinton and that male candidates will also face similar criticism.

Overall, the author argues that Clinton's candidacy has created a burden for her as the barometer of gender equality in the United States, and that the outcome of her campaign will have significant implications for the future of women in politics."
  The text discusses the killing of Walter Scott, an unarmed black man, by a white police officer in North Charleston, South Carolina. The author argues that the incident highlights broader issues of police violence and the need for better data collection and accountability. The author notes that while the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 requires the federal Justice Department to collect data on police killings, the data has never been fully implemented, leaving a patchy and incomplete picture of police violence. The author calls for the Justice Department to collect comprehensive data from local departments and for the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing to push for greater transparency and accountability. The author also notes that the lack of comprehensive data makes it difficult to determine the extent of police violence and to address underlying issues of racial bias.
"  The article discusses a recent decision by the District Attorney in Nashville, Tennessee to stop offering female sterilization as part of plea deals in criminal cases. The practice had been in place for five years, with four instances of sterilization being offered to defendants as part of their plea deals. The decision to stop the practice has sparked outrage and debate, with some arguing that it is a violation of the defendants' constitutional rights and others suggesting that it is a form of ""cruel and unusual punishment.""

The article examines the legal basis for sterilization as a punishment, noting that it is linked to the controversial ""eugenics"" movement of the early 20th century. The Supreme Court has never explicitly overruled the 1927 case of Buck v. Bell, in which the justices ruled that a state statute permitting compulsory sterilization of the unfit and ""imbeciles"" was constitutional. However, the Court has struck down similar laws in other cases, such as Skinner v. Oklahoma, which found that a law permitting compulsory sterilization of criminals was unconstitutional.

The article also raises questions about the moral and ethical implications of sterilization as a punishment, noting that it is disproportionately applied to men and that it does not address the underlying issues that led to the criminal behavior. The author suggests that the practice is more acceptable when applied to men, as it is seen as a way to prevent them from committing further crimes, but that it is less acceptable when applied to women, as it is seen as a violation of their reproductive rights.

Overall, the article presents a nuanced and thought-provoking analysis of the controversy surrounding sterilization as a punishment, raising important questions about the legal, moral, and ethical implications of the practice."
"  The text discusses the issue of citizenship for people born in U.S. territories, particularly in American Samoa. Emy Afalava, a decorated veteran and loyal American, was born in American Samoa but has been denied the right to vote and become a citizen due to a longstanding government policy. The text explains that the Constitution grants citizenship to all persons born in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction, but federal officials have maintained that people born in U.S. territories are not citizens. The text notes that this policy has been challenged in a federal lawsuit and a decision is pending. The text also highlights the history of racial discrimination in the U.S. legal system, including the infamous Dred Scott case, which declared that free African-Americans had ""no rights that the white man was bound to respect."" The text argues that it is unjust that Afalava and other American Samoans are still waiting to become citizens, and that it is time to put an end to this ""farce."""
"  After two days of deliberation, the jury found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty on all counts in the Boston Marathon bombing. However, the verdict does not provide a solution to preventing similar acts of violence in the future. The issue is more complex than just blaming Islam, as there are many young Muslims who are peaceful and law-abiding. The problem lies in the intersection of politics, religion, and religious identity, which can lead to radicalization.

There are many factors that contribute to radicalization, including political instability, corruption, foreign intervention, religious illiteracy, and lack of economic opportunity. These grievances are exploited by extremists who offer a simplistic and misguided solution to these problems.

To fight extremism, it is important to show young Muslims that violence is not the answer. Instead, we need to pose the question to them: ""Do you want to help your brothers and sisters in faith?"" By addressing the real grievances that lead to radicalization, we can prevent young Muslims from turning to violence. This requires a more engaged and active Muslim community that is willing to work with others to get things done.

It is also important to recognize that the solution to extremism is not a simple one, and it cannot be achieved through a single reform or change in Islam. It requires a concerted effort from all members of society, including Muslims, to address the underlying issues that lead to radicalization.

In conclusion, the verdict in the Boston Marathon bombing trial is a reminder that the fight against extremism is a complex and ongoing challenge. It requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the root causes of radicalization and promotes a more engaged and active Muslim community. By working together, we can create a safer and more peaceful world for all."

Apple recently released an updated version of its mobile operating system, which includes more diverse emojis. The new emojis include different skin tones, as well as emojis representing same-sex couples and other minority groups. The update has been met with a range of reactions, from cheers to jeers. Some people are pleased to see greater diversity in the emojis, while others are critical of the inclusion of same-sex couples and other groups. The article notes that the new emojis are a step in the right direction, as America's demographics are changing and representations of who we are should reflect this. However, the article also acknowledges that there are still other minority groups that are being left out, such as redheads. The article concludes by asking why it took Apple so long to include more diverse emojis and expressing hope that other companies will follow suit."
  The text discusses the killing of Walter Scott by North Charleston police officer Michael Slager, and the role that body cameras could have played in preventing the tragedy. The author argues that while body cameras are not a long-term solution to the problem of racial bias in law enforcement, they can help to reduce use-of-force incidents and improve police-community relations. The author notes that studies have shown that both police and community members behave better when they know they are on camera, and that body cameras can help to compensate for the underlying problem of racial bias in the criminal justice system. The author suggests that setting tougher employment screening standards and providing more training to help officers recognize and adjust for bias can also help to address the problem. However, the author acknowledges that social change may take generations, and that in the meantime, body cameras can help to shine a bright spotlight on racial bias in law enforcement.
  The Pentagon has released a map showing that coalition forces have regained control of 25-30% of Iraqi territory previously held by ISIS. According to counterinsurgency specialist Afzal Ashraf, this gain is significant but it's important to remember that insurgencies are adaptable and can quickly regain lost ground. Ashraf notes that ISIS's losses are mostly around the edges of their territory, indicating a conventional push forward by Iraqi forces. However, Ashraf believes that the coalition's strategy is not yet effective as they are not using maneuverist warfare, which would involve using air power to take land along main supply routes and put friendly forces on that land to cut off ISIS's supply lines. He also notes that the Middle Eastern nations have not developed an effective coalition to target ISIS, which is an existential threat to the region. In regards to Ramadi, Ashraf states that ISIS is likely pushing there because they have a lot of support in the area and it diverts their attention away from losses to gains. He also notes that ISIS is losing in the rhetorical war being fought in the media, but they are still not standing and fighting where it counts.

  The text describes the devastating situation in the Yarmouk refugee camp in Syria, which has been ravaged by the ongoing civil war and the siege by pro-government forces. The camp, which was set up in the 1950s for Palestinian refugees, has been transformed into a battleground with little to no aid or assistance reaching the trapped civilians. The Syrian government has been bombing and shelling the area with barrel bombs, causing widespread destruction and loss of life. The situation is made worse by the fact that most of the fighting forces on all sides are Palestinian, adding a layer of complexity to the conflict. The residents of Yarmouk are facing extreme hardship, with limited access to food, water, and medical care. Despite their defiance, the residents are at a loss as to how to protect themselves from the ongoing violence. The text highlights the plight of the civilians trapped in the camp, who are caught in the middle of a war with little hope of escape. The UNRWA, the U.N. agency tasked with aiding Palestinians, is unable to provide adequate assistance due to the limited access to the area. The text concludes that the situation in Yarmouk is a tragic example of the consequences of the ongoing conflict in Syria, and the need for greater international intervention to address the humanitarian crisis.

"  The text discusses the concept of ""happy endings"" in the context of tax filing in the United States. The author argues that the tax system is designed to provide a ""happy ending"" for most taxpayers, with many receiving a refund check of around $3000. The author suggests that this positive outcome is due to the simplification of tax filing, with many service providers offering free filing and additional services such as ""audit protection insurance."" The author notes that while there are still issues with the tax system, such as biased laws that favor the wealthy, the focus is on the positive outcome for most taxpayers, who are able to spend their refunds on various purchases. The author uses the metaphor of a colonoscopy to illustrate the idea that even unpleasant experiences can be remembered as positive if they end well."
  Aaron Hernandez, a former New England Patriot, will need to keep his lawyers even after being convicted of murder and other charges.
