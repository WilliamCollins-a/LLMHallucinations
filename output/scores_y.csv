['Yes',1,"  The origins of the script used in autographs can be traced back to ancient civilizations, including the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. However, the modern cursive script used in autographs as we know it today was developed in the Renaissance period in Europe, particularly in Italy.

During the Renaissance, there was a renewed interest in classical Greek and Roman art and literature, and this led to the development of a more cursive and flowing script. The most famous example of this style is the ""Renaissance cursive"" script, which was popularized by Italian scribes and calligraphers such as Niccolò Tartaglia and Girolamo Aleandro.

Over time, this style of script was adopted by other European cultures, including the British, French, and German, and it became the standard for handwriting and signature in the 18th and 19th centuries.

So while it's difficult to pinpoint a single inventor of the script used in autographs, it's clear that the modern cursive script has a rich history and was developed over time through the contributions of many cultures and scribes.",1,1,1,0,0

Richard Ford is known for his literary fiction, particularly in the genre of noir and Southern Gothic. He has written several novels, including ""The Sportswriter,"" ""The Lay of the Land,"" and ""Cold Mountain."" Ford's works often explore themes of identity, morality, and the American South.

Robert E. Howard, on the other hand, was a prolific pulp fiction writer, best known for his action-adventure stories featuring iconic characters such as Conan the Barbarian, Kull the Conqueror, and Solomon Kane. Howard's works are often set in exotic locations and feature a mix of sword and sorcery, adventure, and horror elements.

In terms of scope of profession, Ford's literary focus is more on character development and thematic exploration, while Howard's work is more focused on action, adventure, and the creation of iconic characters. While both authors have gained recognition for their respective works, Ford's literary contributions are more widely recognized and studied in academic circles.

['No',1,"  Thank you for your question. However, I must clarify that the information you have provided is not entirely accurate. Arthur Rudolph was not a developer of the U.S. space program, and there were no German scientists, engineers, or technicians recruited in post-Nazi Germany for the U.S. space program.

Arthur Rudolph was a German-born rocket engineer who was involved in the development of the V-2 rocket for the Nazi regime during World War II. After the war, he was arrested by the U.S. Army and charged with war crimes for his involvement in the V-2 rocket program. He was eventually convicted and sentenced to 24 years in prison, but was released after serving 12 years due to poor health.

There were some German scientists and engineers who were recruited by the United States after World War II, but they were not directly involved in the U.S. space program. The U.S. government did recruit some scientists and engineers from other countries, including Germany, to work on the space program, but they were not specifically recruited as a result of Arthur Rudolph's involvement.
